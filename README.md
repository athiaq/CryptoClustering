# CryptoClustering

Through this challenge, python and unsupervised machine learning was used to predict the effect of 24 hour or 7 day price changes on crypto currencies. First, the best value for k using the original scaled dataframe was found. The Original Scaled Data was used to find the Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means. Principl Component Analysis was perfomed to optimize clusters. The PCA data was used to find the best value for k. Lastly, the PCA data was used to find the cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means.
